    " - Step 5: use command vi app.py to edit the file and add some comments\n",

    " - Step 7: commit the edited file\n",
    " - Step 8: now switch to master branch. you will see that the comments are gone\n",
    " - Step 9: create a new file config.py in dev branch\n",
    " - Step 10: now switch again to master branch. the file is not visible in master branch\n",
