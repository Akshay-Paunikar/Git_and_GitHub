    "<b>1. What is git stockpile, and how does it work? How do you use it?</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Stockpile is a protocol aware caching system which has been designed to temporarily store data from the Mojang API in order to prevent unnecessary requests and simplify tasks such as the retrieval of name associations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically Stockpile provides:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Persisted name associations\n",
    "    - Within the default configuration, name associations will be stored for the maximum permitted time (e.g. names will not suddenly disappear when a player changes their name)\n",
    " - Rate limit management\n",
    "    - Especially on systems where multiple servers are running on the same physical machine, you may end up exceeding the rate limit of 600 requests per 10 minutes (or 1 request per minute for profiles) - Stockpile alleviates this issue by making the information globally accessible to all instances even when many implementations request information\n",
    " - Centralized Storage\n",
    "    - Stockpile provides a central point of storage and thus gets rid of the need to implement custom caching logic in your code\n",
    " - Events\n",
    "    - Automatically perform tasks within your infrastructure when new elements are written to the cache"

    "<b>2. Describe the various branching strategies.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Feature Branching:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Create a branch for each new feature.\n",
    " - Isolate development work for specific features.\n",
    " - Merge back into the main branch when the feature is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Gitflow Workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Defines a strict branching model with specific branches for features, releases, and hotfixes.\n",
    " - Main branches include master, develop, feature, release, and hotfix branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. GitHub Flow:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Simplified workflow with a single branch (typically \"main\").\n",
    " - Commits trigger automated deployment.\n",
    " - Ideal for continuous delivery and quick releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. GitLab Flow:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Similar to GitHub Flow but includes additional protection branches for stability.\n",
    " - Uses protection rules on branches to control the flow of changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Trunk-Based Development:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Keep the main branch (trunk) always deployable.\n",
    " - Developers commit directly to the main branch frequently.\n",
    " - Relies on feature toggles and short-lived branches for new features.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Release Branching:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Create a branch for a stable release to fix bugs or make minor updates.\n",
    " - Helps maintain stability in the main branch while preparing for a release.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Centralized Workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Simplest approach with a single branch (usually \"master\").\n",
    " - Developers commit directly to the main branch or fork repositories for isolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each strategy has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice depends on the project's requirements, team size, and development workflow preferences."
