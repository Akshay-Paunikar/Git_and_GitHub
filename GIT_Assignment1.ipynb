    "git stash list is a Git command that displays a list of stashes in the repository. Stashes are used to temporarily save changes that are not ready to be committed, allowing you to switch to a different branch or apply the changes later. The command shows a numbered list of stashes, making it easy to reference or apply a specific stash."

It happens when conflicting changes are made to the same part of a file in the branches being merged. Resolving conflicts requires manual intervention by the user to decide how to combine or prioritize the conflicting changes."

    "\n",
    "Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project by managing a history of changes. Here's a brief explanation of how Git works:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>1. Repository:</b> Git stores project history and code changes in a repository, which can be local or remote.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>2. Snapshots:</b> Instead of tracking file changes, Git captures snapshots of the entire project at different points in time, providing efficiency and speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>3. Branching:</b> Developers can create branches to work on features or fixes independently. Branches can later be merged to incorporate changes into the main project.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>4. Commits:</b> Developers make commits to save changes to the repository. Each commit has a unique identifier and contains information about what was changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>5. Distributed:</b> Git is distributed, meaning each developer has a complete copy of the project and its history. This allows for offline work and collaboration without a central server.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>6. Merge and Conflict Resolution:</b> Git handles merging changes from different branches. In case of conflicts, users resolve them manually, ensuring smooth collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>7. Remote Repositories:</b> Developers can push changes to a remote repository (e.g., on GitHub). This facilitates collaboration among team members and provides a centralized location for the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Git provides a robust and flexible version control system for managing collaborative software development projects."
